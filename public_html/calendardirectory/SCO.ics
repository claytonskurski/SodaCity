 ented recreation opportunities. The land was badly eroded and very little w
 ildlife was to be found when the refuge was purchased by the federal govern
 ment under the provisions of the Resettlement Act. Efforts began immediatel
 y to restore this damaged\, barren land to a healthy\, rich habitat for the
  plants and animals that once lived here.
